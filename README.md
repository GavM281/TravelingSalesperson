# TravelingSalesperson

Project from CS211.

Made in Java using Swing and AWT for the GUI.

Given a list of orders with order numbers, time waiting and GPS co-ordinates this code tries to find the best route that will result in the fewest number of 'late minutes' where a late minute is any minute over 30.

Uses the nearest neighbor algorithm followed by the 2-opt algorithm that will improve the time by removing any crossovers.
